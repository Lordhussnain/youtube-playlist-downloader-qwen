# YT Playlist Downloader

Batch YouTube playlist downloader and converter, built with Bun + TypeScript.
Feed it a list of playlist or video links and it handles fetching, format
selection, subtitle/thumbnail/description extraction, and conversion — with
a terminal UI and a web dashboard to watch it all happen.

## Features

- **Batch downloads** from a list of YouTube playlist or video URLs defined in `config.json`
- **Concurrent worker pools** for downloading, metadata fetching, and format conversion, all driven by job state in a central SQLite database
- **aria2c multi-connection downloads** — files split across up to 64 streams (16 by default) with automatic fallback to yt-dlp's native downloader when aria2c is not installed or for HLS/live streams. aria2c's own per-server connection cap (16) is clamped automatically, and a downloader argument aria2c rejects (exit 28) pauses the engine with a `BAD_DOWNLOADER_ARGS` reason instead of failing every video in the batch
- **Bandwidth-aware scaling** — an optional global cap is split across the active download slots, and the autoscaler grows the pool while the queue has backlog and bandwidth headroom
- **Resilient by design** — interrupted downloads keep their `.part` file and resume exactly where they stopped; the retry budget only shrinks while a video makes no forward progress
- **Automatic retries** with exponential backoff + jitter on transient failures (network drops, throttling, timeouts)
- **Permanent-failure detection** — private / removed / age-gated / geo-blocked videos fail fast and are never auto-requeued
- **Self-healing sweeps** — crashed jobs resume, stale claims are reclaimed, deleted downloads are re-fetched, and failed jobs are retried after a cooldown. With aria2c these sweeps resume from the download's `.aria2` control file, and a discarded partial always takes its control file with it
- **Single-instance safety** — the web port acts as a lock: starting a second engine against the same `archive.db` refuses to start (with an actionable message) instead of re-queueing the running instance's in-flight work. If a restart-from-scratch hits a partial file locked by another program (orphaned aria2c/ffmpeg, antivirus), the video is retried later with that exact reason in `last_error` instead of being wedged
- **Duration-aware watchdog** — long videos are not killed by a flat 15-minute timeout
- **Disk space precheck** before starting a batch
- **Graceful shutdown** — safely stops in-flight downloads on exit
- **Terminal UI (TUI)** with live progress across all workers
- Correct format selection across VP9/AV1 containers (fixes yt-dlp/ffmpeg mismatches)
- **Multi-audio tracks** — YouTube's multi-language audio (the player's *Audio track* menu: original + auto-dubbed tracks). Keep every track, or just the languages you want, muxed into one MKV whose audio is switchable in any player — plus a per-video track picker in the dashboard
- Compatible with authenticated downloads (`--cookies`) alongside the Android player-client extractor args
- **cookies.txt is watched while the engine runs** — export it from your browser after startup (or replace it when it expires) and the next download attempt uses it; the engine logs the switch and tells you how many credential-blocked jobs it may rescue
- **Web dashboard** with live job status, bulk actions, failed-job recovery, a reliability panel, per-job detail, and an in-browser settings editor for the downloader

## Tech Stack

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) + TypeScript — runtime and application logic
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) — video and metadata extraction
- [aria2c](https://aria2.github.io/) — optional multi-connection downloading
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) — format conversion

## Requirements

- Bun ≥ 1.0
- `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` available on `PATH` (or configured explicitly)
- [aria2c](https://aria2.github.io/) **optional** — enables multi-connection downloads; without it the engine uses yt-dlp's native downloader
- Tested on Windows 11

Dependencies are checked automatically on startup; the app exits with a clear
error if anything required is missing. A missing aria2c is reported as a
warning and never blocks startup.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
bun test            # unit + end-to-end suite (mocked yt-dlp/ffmpeg, no network needed)
bun run check       # both
```

The end-to-end tests (`tests/integration.test.ts`) run the real engine against
the mock binaries in `tests/mocks/`, covering the happy path, transient-failure
retries, corrupt-partial resume, permanent failures, and restart reconciliation.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
bun install
```

## Configuration

`config.json` is created from defaults on the first run (`bun run start`) and
edited interactively with `bun run config`. It is a flat object validated by the
Zod schema in `src/config.ts`; any key you omit falls back to its default, so a
minimal file looks like:

```json
{
  "playlists": ["https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=..."],
  "channels": ["https://www.youtube.com/@somechannel"],
  "channelPlaylists": [],
  "outputRoot": "D:/Downloads/YT",
  "videoQuality": "1080p",
  "targetFormat": "mp4",
  "subtitleFormat": "srt",
  "downloadSubtitles": true,
  "writeThumbnail": true,
  "writeDescription": true,
  "writeInfoJson": true
}
```

### Output format settings

| Key | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `videoQuality` | `"1080p"` | Format preset: `highest`, `1080p`, `720p`, `480p`, or `audio` (mp3 only). |
| `targetFormat` | `"mp4"` | Container the converter remuxes into: `mp4`, `mkv`, `webm`, `mp3`, or `m4a`. `mp4` keeps the video stream and re-encodes audio to AAC; the other containers stream-copy both. A file that already carries the target extension skips conversion, and multi-audio MKVs are never remuxed to mp4 (that would drop the dubs). |
| `subtitleFormat` | `"srt"` | yt-dlp `--convert-subs` target for downloaded subtitles: `srt`, `vtt`, `ass`, or `lrc`. |
| `deleteSourceAfterConvert` | `true` | Remove the pre-conversion source once the converted file is recorded. |
| `secondaryStoragePath` | `""` | Optional NAS/second drive the converter moves finished files (and their sidecars) into. |

### Reliability settings

```json
{
  "maxResumeAttempts": 5,
  "retryBackoffBaseSeconds": 30,
  "retryBackoffMaxSeconds": 900,
  "requeueFailedAfterMinutes": 30,
  "verifyExistingFiles": true,
  "downloadTimeoutMinutes": 15,
  "maxDownloadMinutes": 180
}
```

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `maxResumeAttempts` | How many times one video may resume from its `.part` file before the partial is discarded and the download restarts from scratch |
| `retryBackoffBaseSeconds` / `retryBackoffMaxSeconds` | Exponential backoff window (with jitter) for transient failures — base doubles per retry, capped at the max |
| `requeueFailedAfterMinutes` | Cooldown before failed jobs are retried automatically (`0` disables the sweep). Permanent failures are never re-queued |
| `verifyExistingFiles` | On startup, verify that files recorded as downloaded still exist; missing ones are scrubbed from the yt-dlp archive and queued again |
| `downloadTimeoutMinutes` | Minimum per-video download timeout |
| `maxDownloadMinutes` | Ceiling for the timeout. The effective timeout scales with the video's real duration (3× realtime + 5 min) between the two |

Edit these interactively with `bun run config` → **Change Reliability & Resume**.

### Notifications (webhook)

```json
{
  "webhookUrl": "",
  "notifyOn": ["failure", "pause"]
}
```

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `webhookUrl` | A Discord webhook URL (gets a `{content}` message) or any endpoint accepting JSON POSTs (gets `{event, message, at, details}`). Empty = notifications off |
| `notifyOn` | Which events to send: `failure` (permanent failures, **batched** into one message per 30 s), `pause` (the engine paused itself — cookies, disk, circuit breaker, bad downloader args), `resume`, `complete` (the queue drained) |

Webhooks are fire-and-forget: a slow or failing endpoint is logged to
`error.log` and never slows the pipeline. Both keys are editable from the
dashboard's **Settings → Notifications** group and `bun run config`.

### Download performance settings

| Key | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `useAria2c` | `true` | Download through aria2c for multi-connection transfers. Falls back to yt-dlp's native downloader when the binary is missing, or for HLS/live streams which aria2c cannot serve. |
| `aria2cPath` | `""` | Where aria2c lives; blank auto-detects (PATH, app folder, winget/scoop/choco). Set to `"none"` to force-disable aria2c even when installed — the engine then always uses yt-dlp's native downloader. |
| `connectionsPerDownload` | `16` | aria2c `-s`/`-j` — how finely a file is split (1–64). aria2c hard-caps per-server connections (`-x`) at 16; the engine clamps it, so values above 16 split finer without opening impossible connections. |
| `minSplitSize` | `"1M"` | Smallest file size aria2c will split into multiple connections. Must be an aria2c size (`512K`, `1M`, …) — a value aria2c rejects pauses the engine (`BAD_DOWNLOADER_ARGS`) rather than failing every download. |
| `concurrentFragments` | `16` | Parallel DASH/HLS fragments for yt-dlp's native downloader. |
| `fragmentRetries` | `10` | Retries per fragment before a download fails. |
| `httpChunkSize` | `""` | Range-based chunked downloading on the native path (e.g. `"10M"`). Off by default — some CDNs mishandle `Range` requests. |
| `bufferSize` | `""` | yt-dlp socket buffer size (e.g. `"16K"`); blank uses yt-dlp's default. |
| `autoscaleRampStep` | `2` | Download slots added per autoscale tick while the queue has backlog. |
| `maxBandwidthKBps` | `0` | Global bandwidth cap; split across the active download slots and forwarded to aria2c as `--max-overall-download-limit`. |

### Multi-audio tracks (YouTube multi-language audio)

YouTube now ships many videos with several audio tracks — the original language
plus auto-dubbed ones, exactly what the player's **Audio track** menu lists.
The engine can download them the same way:

| Key | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `multiAudioMode` | `"off"` | `off` = classic single-track download. `all` = keep every audio track the video offers. `languages` = keep only the codes in `audioTrackLanguages`. |
| `audioTrackLanguages` | `[]` | Language codes kept in `languages` mode (e.g. `["en", "ja"]`). |

How it works: before a download the worker asks yt-dlp which audio tracks the
video offers (one cheap metadata pass, cached per job), picks the best stream of
each wanted track (DRC duplicates are ignored), and hands the selection to
yt-dlp as `bv…+<track1>+<track2>… --audio-multistreams --merge-output-format mkv`.
The result is one MKV whose audio tracks you switch in VLC/mpv/Plex just like on
YouTube. Multi-track files are never remuxed to mp4 (that would drop the dubs);
a single selected track merges exactly like a classic download. `videoQuality:
"audio"` (mp3) always stays single-track.

Per-video override: open a job in the dashboard and use the **Audio tracks**
section — *Find audio tracks* lists what YouTube offers (original + dubs, with
language and bitrate), checkboxes pick what the next attempt keeps, and *Use
global setting* returns the job to the mode above. The selection applies to the
next download attempt (use **Retry job** to re-fetch an already downloaded
video with different tracks).

### Tuning from the dashboard

The **⚙️ Settings** button opens an editor for the downloader, concurrency, and
reliability knobs. Changes are validated against the same Zod schema the engine
uses, written to `config.json`, and applied to the running engine — the next
download picks them up without a restart. The panel deliberately exposes only
tuning keys: playlists, credentials, and the network binding are not editable
from the browser, and a request naming anything outside the allow-list is
rejected rather than silently ignored.

Click any job row for its detail view (file paths, sizes, duration, retry/resume
counts, the kept partial and its aria2c control file, and the last error).
Keyboard: <kbd>/</kbd> search, <kbd>s</kbd> settings, <kbd>p</kbd> pause/resume,
<kbd>r</kbd> refresh, <kbd>Esc</kbd> close.

### The reliability panel

The panel is a live read of what the engine is actually doing about failures,
not a static list of settings:

- **Downloader** — engine in use, connections per download, concurrent
  fragments, the bandwidth cap, and the autoscale ramp step.
- **Will resume** — jobs that still hold a `.part` file and are therefore still
  in play (`pending`, `paused`, or `downloading`). Their job rows carry a
  `⏸️ partial · will resume` pill whose tooltip shows the `.part` path and its
  `.aria2` control file.
- **Interrupted** — jobs parked as `paused` + `interrupted`, i.e. the ones the
  crashed-jobs sweep will re-claim and continue rather than restart.
- **Stale claims** — what the reaper would reclaim right now: claims older than
  the thresholds from `STALE_CLAIM_THRESHOLDS(config)` — downloads with no
  progress heartbeat for `max(20, maxDownloadMinutes)` minutes, conversions
  3 h, metadata 15 min. The panel calls the same function the sweep uses, so
  it cannot advertise a timeout the sweep does not enforce. (Downloads refresh
  their claim timestamp on every progress tick, so a long but healthy transfer
  is never reclaimed from under a live yt-dlp.)
- **Self-healing sweeps** — the five sweeps with their cadence, a pending
  count, and the sweep's **last error** if its most recent run threw (a red
  `error` pill with the message in the tooltip — a failing sweep is otherwise
  indistinguishable from one with nothing to do). Deleted-files is
  `startup`-only and stats every recorded file, so its count is reported as
  unknown rather than guessed.

Every count comes from `GET /api/reliability`, which reads the live config (not
a startup snapshot) and the job table.

### Web dashboard & API

The dashboard (`web_ui.html`, served at `/`) shows live stats, a workers strip
(what each DL/MD/CV worker is doing right now), the reliability panel, a
sortable/filterable job table, a per-job detail drawer, failed-job and run-history
tabs, and the log viewer. It polls only while the tab is visible.

All endpoints answer `{ ok: true|false, … }`, unknown API paths are a JSON 404,
and a known path with the wrong method is a JSON 405 (+ `Allow`). When
`webToken` is set, every route requires the token (cookie, `Authorization:
Bearer`, `X-Web-Token`, or `?token=`).

| Method & path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/ping` | Liveness probe (also answers `HEAD`). |
| `GET /api/version` | Engine/runtime info (Bun version, platform, uptime). |
| `GET /api/status` | Stats, aggregate speed, workers, pause state, disk/RAM, ETA. |
| `GET /api/jobs` | The 500 newest jobs. |
| `GET /api/jobs/:id` | One job, fresh from the DB (what the detail drawer shows). |
| `POST /api/jobs/:id/retry` | Re-queue with fresh budgets (alias: `POST /api/retry/:id`). |
| `POST /api/jobs/:id/reset-failures` | Clear the per-stage failure counters (alias: `POST /api/failcount/reset/:id`). |
| `POST /api/jobs/:id/override` | Per-video override: `{targetFormat?, quality?, wantSubtitles?, retry?}`. A format change on a downloaded video only re-runs the converter; `retry: true` re-queues the download (needed for a new quality). 409 while the job is mid-flight. |
| `POST /api/jobs/:id/audio-tracks` | Save the per-video audio-track selection (`tracks: null` resets). |
| `POST /api/jobs/:id/audio-probe` | Discover the audio tracks YouTube offers for this video. |
| `DELETE /api/jobs/:id` | Delete one job row. |
| `POST /api/jobs/pause` | Bulk user-pause `{ "ids": [...] }`. |
| `DELETE /api/jobs` | Bulk delete `{ "ids": [...] }` (alias: `POST /api/jobs/delete`). |
| `POST /api/scan` | Scan/add a playlist or channel `{ "url", "folder?" }`. |
| `POST /api/queue/purge` | Delete all pending/paused/waiting/failed jobs. |
| `POST /api/pause` · `POST /api/resume` | Pause/resume the whole engine. |
| `GET /api/failed` · `POST /api/failed/requeue` | Failed jobs; requeue all eligible (ignores cooldown). |
| `GET`/`POST /api/settings` | Dashboard-editable settings snapshot / validated patch. |
| `GET /api/reliability` | Resume + self-healing snapshot (see above). |
| `GET /api/history?limit=` · `GET /api/logs?type=error\|report&limit=` | Run history; logs. |

The terminal UI carries the same signal: the header line gains a `Res:n` field
whenever jobs are holding a partial they will resume from, so a paused engine
reports its resume state without needing the browser open.

**How resume works with aria2c.** aria2c keeps a *control file* next to every
in-progress download (`<name>.part.aria2`) recording which pieces have arrived.
An interrupted transfer leaves both files, and the next attempt resumes from
them — so enabling aria2c does not weaken resume. When the engine decides a
partial is unusable it deletes the `.part` **and** its control file: aria2c
defaults to `--allow-overwrite=false`, under which a control file whose data is
gone makes it neither resume nor restart, wedging the job permanently.

Edit these interactively with `bun run config` → **Change Download Settings**,
or from the web dashboard's **⚙️ Settings** panel.

## Usage

```bash
bun run start        # reads ./config.json from the current directory
bun run config       # interactive config manager
```

There are no CLI flags: everything is read from `config.json` in the working
directory (`archive.db`, `error.log`, and `downloaded_videos.txt` are created
there too), so run the engine from the folder that holds your config.

The TUI shows live status for every video across all active workers. The web
dashboard (`http://127.0.0.1:3000` by default) adds bulk actions, the failed-job
tab, run history, and a live reliability panel.

## Architecture

```
batch_playlist_downloader.ts     entry point (bun run start / build:win)
update_config.ts                 interactive config manager (shares src/config.ts)
web_ui.html                      dashboard frontend (served by src/web.ts)
src/
  config.ts        Zod schema + defaults + load/save (single source of truth)
  db.ts            SQLite schema, migrations, atomic job claims
  state.ts         shared mutable runtime state (pause, stats, workers)
  tools.ts         yt-dlp/ffmpeg/aria2c discovery + cookies helpers
  download-args.ts pure yt-dlp command construction (downloader engine, tuning)
  retry.ts         pure retry policy: backoff, watchdogs, error classification
  resilience.ts    pause/resume, circuit breaker, network + disk guards
  reconcile.ts     self-healing sweeps (crashes, stale claims, missing files, failed jobs)
  scanner.ts       playlist/channel scanning + deduplicated ingestion
  workers/         download, metadata, and conversion worker loops
  autoscale.ts     dynamic download-slot autoscaling
  rss.ts           cheap per-channel RSS new-upload watcher
  polling.ts       daemon-mode full rescans
  dashboard.ts     TUI
  report.ts        human-readable run report
  web.ts           dashboard server + JSON API + token auth
  history.ts       heartbeated run history
  lifecycle.ts     worker supervision + graceful shutdown
  engine.ts        orchestration (main)
tests/             bun test suite (unit + end-to-end with mocked tools)
```

## How It Works

1. **Startup** — load config, verify dependencies, open/migrate the database,
   then self-heal: reconcile crashed jobs, re-queue jobs whose files vanished,
   clean up unusable partials
2. **Scan** — every configured playlist/channel is listed (yt-dlp flat scan or
   cheap RSS polling) and deduplicated into the jobs table by video id
3. **Download workers** — pull videos into the configured output directory
   through aria2c (multi-connection) when available, otherwise yt-dlp's native
   downloader. Failures keep the `.part` file and retry with exponential
   backoff; the retry budget only shrinks while the video makes no forward
   progress
4. **Metadata workers** — fetch subtitles, thumbnails, and descriptions per video, based on config flags
5. **Converter workers** — convert completed downloads into the target format,
   optionally moving them (with sidecars) to a secondary storage path
6. **Sweeps** — every minute: reclaim stale claims, re-queue cooled-down
   transient failures, heartbeat the run history

## Security & operations

- **Loopback-only Web UI by default** — `webBind` defaults to `127.0.0.1`, so the
  dashboard (pause/purge/delete!) is not reachable from your LAN. Set
  `"webBind": "0.0.0.0"` to expose it deliberately.
- **Optional shared-secret token** — set `webToken` and every request (UI and
  API) needs it, via cookie, `Authorization: Bearer`, `X-Web-Token`, or
  `?token=`. The login page sets an `HttpOnly` cookie after the first
  sign-in; comparisons are timing-safe.
- **Auth posture, stated plainly:** `webToken` defaults to `""`, which means
  the API is **fully open** to anything that can reach the port — including
  purge, delete, and the settings editor. That is acceptable on loopback;
  if you set `"webBind": "0.0.0.0"` you widen the unauthenticated surface to
  the whole network, so **always set a `webToken` when binding beyond
  loopback** (the config manager warns about this combination). The engine
  also sends `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, a
  restrictive `Content-Security-Policy`, and `Cache-Control: no-store` on
  every response. The browser receives the token only as an HttpOnly cookie;
  `bun run config` → View masks it.
- **Keep `cookies.txt` out of version control** — it is a live browser
  session. `.gitignore` excludes it (along with `archive.db`, media files, and
  partial downloads).
- **Real bandwidth cap** — `maxBandwidthKBps` maps to yt-dlp `--limit-rate`,
  split across the active download slots.
- **Worker autoscaling** — with `autoscaleEnabled` the engine grows download
  slots toward `maxDownloadWorkers` while a backlog exists and bandwidth
  headroom remains, sheds slots when the cap saturates, and returns to
  `minDownloadWorkers` when idle.
- **Cheap new-upload watching** — `rssEnabled` polls each channel's RSS feed
  every `rssPollIntervalMinutes` (one HTTP GET per channel, ~15 min latency)
  instead of waiting for a full rescan.
- **Circuit breaker** — after `maxFailures` consecutive pipeline failures
  (dead cookies overnight, a YouTube outage) the engine pauses itself with
  `TOO_MANY_FAILURES` instead of burning through the queue. Resume from the
  UI when you're ready. Per-video, the effective retry cap is
  `min(maxRetryAttempts, maxFailuresPerVideo)`.
- **yt-dlp download archive** — `archiveFile` is passed to
  `--download-archive` as a second idempotence layer; if a downloaded file
  disappears (moved/deleted by hand) the archive entry is scrubbed and the
  video is fetched again on the next attempt.
- **Startup file reconciliation** — with `verifyExistingFiles` (default on) the
  engine checks that every file it recorded as downloaded still exists on
  disk; anything missing is scrubbed from the archive and re-queued instead of
  being silently skipped forever.
- **Wait for VOD** — with `archiveLiveStreams` enabled, currently-live
  streams are never grabbed mid-broadcast: the job parks as
  `waiting for VOD` and is re-queued by the next scan/RSS pass once the
  stream has ended.

## Roadmap

- [x] Central SQLite job database — persist per-video status (`pending` →
      `downloading` → `downloaded` → `converted`) so downloads survive
      crashes and restarts, and workers claim jobs atomically instead of
      relying on in-memory state
- [x] Resume interrupted downloads from exactly where they left off
      (`.part` files kept, `--continue`, bounded resume budget)
- [x] Fully independent, parallel metadata and conversion pipelines
- [x] Modular architecture with a unit + end-to-end test suite
- [ ] Deduplicate identical videos across playlists by content hash
- [x] Per-video format / quality / subtitle overrides from the job drawer
      (`POST /api/jobs/:id/override`, "Apply" or "Apply & re-download")
- [x] Webhook notifications (Discord or generic JSON) on pause/resume, batched
      failures and queue completion (`webhookUrl` / `notifyOn`)
- [ ] Download scheduling windows, retention policies, chapter/transcript sidecars

## Windows 11

The engine is fully supported on Windows 11. Recommended setup:

**Quick start (no runtime install):**

```powershell
# 1. Build the standalone exe (requires Bun once, on any machine)
bun run build:win          # → dist\youtube-archive.exe

# 2. Double-click:
start-archive.bat
```

`start-archive.bat` sets UTF-8 codepage, puts the app folder first on `PATH`
(so a local `yt-dlp.exe` / `ffmpeg.exe` sitting next to the app is picked up
automatically), and prefers the compiled exe over a source checkout. It looks
for the exe in `dist\youtube-archive.exe` first and in the app folder second,
so copying it out of `dist\` is optional — either layout works. If neither
the exe nor Bun is available it says so and names the build command.

**Dependency auto-detection** — at startup the engine searches, in order:

1. `ytDlpPath` / `ffmpegPath` in `config.json` (set them via `bun run config`)
2. `PATH`
3. The app folder (next to `archive.exe` / `config.json`)
4. Winget, Scoop, and Chocolatey shims

**Start automatically at logon:**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install-task.ps1
# to remove later:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install-task.ps1 -Uninstall
```

**Windows-specific safeguards built in:**

- Filenames are stripped of reserved device names (`CON`, `NUL`, `COM1`…),
  trailing dots/spaces, and illegal characters `/\:*?"<>|`
- Long titles are truncated so paths stay under `MAX_PATH` (260) — no registry
  tweak required
- Run history is heartbeated every minute, so even `taskkill /F` or a window
  close still leaves a usable history row
- Interrupted downloads are marked `paused (resume)` and continue from the
  `.part` file on next start
- If `statfs` is unavailable, free space falls back to PowerShell
  (`Get-PSDrive`); if that also fails the engine runs in degraded mode
  instead of pausing forever
